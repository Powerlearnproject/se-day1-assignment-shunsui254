#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 Software engineering is a discipline involved with the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software. 
 Software engineering in technology industry plays a very important role. Ranging fromn soperating system to the simple calculator app running in the said operating system, the role of software engineering can be felt far and wide. Software engineering ensures that the electronic hardware we have can run smoothly and in a way that we want it to(programming)

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. the invention of FORTRAN in 1954. This being the world's introduction to software engineering, it paved way to the innovation and advancemet that we see and interact with today.
2. The publication of the "Mythical Man-Month" by Fred Brooks in 1975: This book highlighted many important ideas for software development including team organization, project management, and communication.
3. The establishment of the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC7 committee in 1987: This committee was responsible for the standardization of software engineering, leading to the development of international standards such as ISO/IEC 12207 for software life cycle processes and ISO/IEC 15504 for software process improvement.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
it involves 3 steps:
1. Requirements Gathering. This is where developers identify and document the needs, requirements and goals of the software project.
2. Analysis. This is where developers use the requirements gathered in the previous phase to design a solution.
3. Design: The design phase is where the architecture of the software solution is created, including the overall structure and interfaces.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology is a sequential development process where each phase must be completed before moving to the next phase. It involves:
1. Linear and sequential development process.
2. Emphasizes planning, design, documentation, and control.
3. Works best for small projects with clearly defined requirements.
4. Not suitable for projects with rapidly changing requirements.
Agile Methodology on the other hand is an iterative and incremental development process where requirements, solutions, and feedback are continuously gathered and incorporated into the software development process. it involves:
1. Iterative and incremental development process.
2. Emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement.
3. Best suited for large, complex projects with unclear or changing requirements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team. 
1. Software Developer: Designs, codes, tests, and maintains software. They work closely with project managers and quality assurance engineers to ensure that the software meets the required specifications and standards.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer: Plans and executes tests to evaluate the quality of software. They identify defects and collaborate with developers to fix them. They also review requirements and documentation to ensure that they are complete and accurate.
3. Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of a software project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. 
1. IDEs: Integrated Development Environments are software tools that provide a comprehensive environment for software development. They typically include features like code editors, debuggers, compilers, and build automation tools. Examples of popular IDEs include Visual Studio, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA.
2. VCS: Version Control Systems are software tools that help developers manage and track changes to their code. They allow developers to collaborate on code, revert to previous versions, and keep a history of changes.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Debugging and testing: My solution to this would be adopting a test-driven development approach, using automated testing tools, and collaborating with QA engineers can help identify and fix bugs more efficiently.
2. Managing deadlinesðŸ˜‚: A good strategic approach to this will be prioritizing tasks, breaking down projects into smaller chunks, and setting realistic deadlines can help prevent last-minute stress.
3. Dealing with complex and changing requirements: I think communication with stakeholders is key to understanding the requirements. Agile methodologies, like Scrum, can also help manage changing requirements.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: Here it involves testing individual units of code to ensure that each module is working properly. This helps identify and fix errors early in the development process, reducing the likelihood of major bugs later on.
2. Integration Testing: This is whereby one is testing the interaction between different modules to ensure that they work together as expected. This helps prevent problems that can arise when multiple components are combined.
3. System Testing: Here we are testing the entire system to ensure that it meets the specified requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of carefully crafting prompts or questions to elicit the desired response from an AI model. It involves understanding the strengths and limitations of the AI model and tailoring your questions accordingly.
The importance of prompt engineering can't be overstated, especially as AI models continue to advance and become more sophisticated. By using effective prompt engineering, you can get better answers, improve the efficiency of your interactions, and even learn more about how the AI model works.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective. 
An example of a vague prompt is, "Tell me about AI" It is vague since it is very open ended and imprecise. a better version of the same prompt is, "explain what artificial intelligence is and some of its key applications"
